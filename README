libreconf - bash helper library for netctl project reconfigure tools
====================================================================

This simple library is used by every reconfigure tools and provide interface
name templates (in library .cfg file), loads reconf.conf file that contains
WO_IF, LO_IF and IFB_IF variables with interface names for world, local and
ifb network devices.

It depends on libnctl and thus provided API is deprecated and should not be
used in new projects too.

Support is still provided as this library is a base for other netctl projects
Library could be a good example of approaches and techniques in bash scripting.
